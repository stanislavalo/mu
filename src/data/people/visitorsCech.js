He authored more than 300 articles. He became famous by his work in Ramsey theory but later obtained significant results in many other branches of combinatorics. Many of his results deal with Erd&#337;s&#39;s problems of which he has solved more than 20, including very difficult ones. In particular he and Peter Frankl proved the Erd&#337;s and Hanani conjecture. The method by which it was solved is referred to as R&ouml;dl nibble. His probably most famous result is a proof of the hypergraph regularity lemma, which he published with his students in a series of articles. This enables one to prove Szemer&eacute;di&#39;s theorem on arithmetic progressions in dense subsets of integers by purely combinatorial means as well as some other results of this kind.<br \/>\r\nVojt&#283;ch R&ouml;dl was the invited speaker on the ICM in Kyoto 1990, and in the ICM in Soul 2014 held a plenary lecture. He is a recipient of many awards, in particular, Der Humboldt-Preis in 1996, Bernard Bolzano Medal in 2011, George P&oacute;lya Prize in 2012.

Galdi is the Leighton E. and Mary N. Orr Professor of Engineering and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh. He is also Honorary Professor in the TATA Institute of Fundamental Research, India, and the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany.<br \/>\r\nHis contribution to the well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations has influenced generations of mathematicians. In particular, his extensive research monograph &quot;An Introduction to the mathematical theory of the Navier-Stokes equations&quot; (Springer-Verlag 2011) dedicated to the resolution of the sixth of the seven Millennium Prize Problems announced by the Clay Institute, has, to date, received over 27,000 downloads. With his work, Prof. Galdi has also pioneered several other fundamental areas of mathematical fluid mechanics, including dynamics of viscoelastic fluids, steady-state and time-periodic bifurcation of flow past an obstacle, and fluid-structure interactions. In this latter respect, in collaboration with his junior associates, in 2015 he published a memoir that positively answers a famous conjecture formulated by Nikolai Joukowsky in 1885 regarding the motion of a body with an interior liquid-filled cavity.<br \/>\r\nPart of the programme of Prof. Galdi&#39;s visit is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.math.cas.cz\/documents\/cech14.pdf\"><span style=\"color:#0000cd;\">14th Eduard &#268;ech Lecture<\/span><\/a> on <span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-size:12px;\">14 December 2017 and the <a href=\"http:\/\/mnse.math.cas.cz\/info.php\"><span style=\"color:#0000cd;\">Minicourse on the Navier-Stokes equations<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-size:12px;\">on February 12&ndash;16, 2018.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span>", "url_photo": "photo_3_5_20180102140311_28.jpg" }
