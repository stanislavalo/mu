    "text": "We present a mathematical model of the intuitive notions such as the knowledge or the information arising at different stages of computations on branching programs (b.p.). The model has two appropriate properties:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\ni) The \"knowledge\" arising at a stage of computation in question is derivable from the \"knowledge\" arising at the previous stage according to the rules of the model and according to the local arrangement of the b.p.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nii) The model confirms the intuitively well-known fact that the knowledge arising at a node of a computation depends not only on it but in some cases also on a \"mystery\" information. (I. e. different computations reaching the same node may have different knowledge(s) arisen at it.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe prove that with respect to our model no such information exists in read-once b.p.`s but on the other hand in b. p.`s which are not read-once such information must be present. The read-once property forms a frontier. More concretely, we may see the instances of our models as a systems $S=(U,D)$ where $U$ is a universe of knowledge and $D$ arederivation rules. We say that a b.p. $P$ is compatible with a system $S$ iff along each computation in $P$ $S$ derives $F$ ($false$) or $T$ ($true$) at the end correctly according to the label of the reached sink. This key notion modifies the classic paradigm according to which the computational complexity is defined with respect to different classes of restricted b.p.`s (e.g. read-once b.p.`s, k-b.p.`s, b.p.`s computing in limited time etc.). Now, the restriction is defined by a subset of systems and only these programs are taken into account which are compatible with at least one of the chosen systems. Further&nbsp; we may understand the sets $U$ of knowledge(s) as a sets of admissible logical formulae.&nbsp; More rich&nbsp; sets $U$`s imply the larger (= more free) restrictions on b.p.`s and consequently the smaller complexities of Boolean functions are detected. More rich logical equipment implies stronger computational effectiveness."

Answering these questions is helpful not only to a potential briber, but also to observers wishing to detect bribery or have meaningful measures of the (surprisingly elusive) notion of margin of victory.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPresburger arithmetic (PrA) is the first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition, named in honor of Mojżesz Presburger who introduced it in 1929 and proved its decidability.

    "text": "Hardness magnification reduces major complexity separations to proving lower bounds for some natural problem Q against weak circuit models. Several recent works have established results of this form. In the most intriguing cases, the required lower bound is known for problems that appear to be significantly easier than Q, while Q itself is susceptible to lower bounds but these are not yet sufficient for magnification. In this work, we provide more examples of this phenomenon, and investigate the prospects of proving new lower bounds using this approach. In particular, we consider the following essential questions associated with the hardness magnification program:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Does hardness magnification avoid the natural proofs barrier of Razborov and Rudich?<br \/>\r\n- Can we adapt known lower bound techniques to establish the desired lower bound for Q?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe establish that some instantiations of hardness magnification overcome the natural proofs barrier in the following sense: slightly superlinear-size circuit lower bounds for certain versions of the minimum circuit size problem MCSP imply the non-existence of natural proofs. As a corollary of our result, we show that certain magnification theorems not only imply strong worst-case circuit lower bounds but also rule out the existence of efficient learning algorithms.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHardness magnification might sidestep natural proofs, but we identify a source of difficulty when trying to adapt existing lower bound techniques to prove strong lower bounds via magnification. This is captured by a locality barrier: existing magnification theorems unconditionally show that the problems Q considered above admit highly efficient circuits extended with small fan-in oracle gates, while lower bound techniques against weak circuit models quite often easily extend to circuits containing such oracles. This explains why direct adaptations of certain lower bounds are unlikely to yield strong complexity separations via hardness magnification.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is a joint work with Lijie Chen, Shuichi Hirahara, Igor C.

    "text": "A (k,n)-zero fixing source X is given by a subset S of [n] of size k. The source X produces 0-1 vectors that are zero outside of S each with probability 2^{-k}. An extractor for a (k,n)-zero fixing source is a mapping F:{0,1}^n\\to {0,1}^l such that F(X) is close to the uniform distribution on {0,1}^l. Such extractors are known for k down to log log n with l=k-O(1). In this talk we will show some constructions for k << log log n and some upper bounds on the amount of entropy that is possible to extract for small k.\r\n\r\nThese problems are closely connected with Ramsey theory.\r\n\r\nJoint work with Vojtěch Rodl.\r\n"

    "text": "In communication complexity the Arthur-Merlin (AM) model is the most natural one that allows both randomness\r\nand non-determinism. Presently we do not have any super-logarithmic lower bound for the AM-complexity of an\r\nexplicit function. Obtaining such a bound is a fundamental challenge to our understanding of communication\r\nphenomena. In this work we explore the gap between the known techniques and the complexity class AM.\r\n\r\nIn the first part we define a new natural class Small-advantage Layered Arthur-Merlin (SLAM) that have the\r\nfollowing properties:\r\n    - SLAM is (strictly) included in AM and includes all previously known sub-AM classes with non-trivial\r\nlower bounds.\r\n    - SLAM is qualitatively stronger than the union of those classes.\r\n    - SLAM is a subject to the discrepancy bound: in particular, the inner product function does not have an\r\nefficient SLAM-protocol.\r\n\r\nStructurally this can be summarised as\r\nSBP ∪ UAM ⊂ SLAM ⊆ AM ∩ PP.\r\n\r\nIn the second part we ask why proving a lower bound of ω(√n) on the MA-complexity of an explicit function\r\nseems to be difficult.\r\n\r\nBoth of these results are related to the notion of layer complexity, which is, informally, the number of\r\n“layers of non-determinism” used by a protocol. We believe that further investigation of this concept may\r\nlead to better understanding of the communication model AM and to non-trivial lower bounds against it.\r\n"
