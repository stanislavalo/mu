Publishers produce new material that needs to be archived safely over the long term, made more visible, usable, and interoperable with the legacy corpus on which it settles. In EuDML, these partners will join together with leading technology providers in constructing the Europe-wide interconnections between their collections to create a document network as integrated and trans-national as the discipline of mathematics itself. They will future-proof their work by providing the organisational and technical infrastructure to accommodate new collections and mathematically rich metadata formats, and will work towards truly open access for the whole European Community to this foundational resource, thereby retaining Europe&#39;s leadership in the provision, accessibility and exploitation of electronic mathematical content.<br \/>\r\nEuDML will design and build a collaborative digital library service that will collate the currently distributed content by the diversity of providers. This will be achieved by implementing a single access platform for heterogeneous and multilingual collections. The network of documents will be constructed by merging and augmenting the information available about each document from each collection, and matching documents and references across the entire combined library.

A particular attention was paid to the cases where X is the space of continuous functions on a bounded interval or X has finite dimension. For systems of ordinary and functional differential equations, we established efficient conditions guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of a solution of the initial-value, periodic, and general non-local boundary value problem, as well as the validity of various theorems on differential inequalities, both in the linear and non-linear cases. In the case of higher-order scalar functional differential equations, efficient solvability conditions were established for the periodic boundary value problem, which are also new for ordinary differential equations. Properties of linear hyperbolic partial differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side, including the Fredholm property of the Darboux and Cauchy problems and the continuous dependence on initial conditions and parameters, were also studied. For certain classes of boundary value problems, we studied possibilities of application of the successive approximation method for the proof of the existence, approximate computation of a solution, and error estimation of the approximation. Some of the topics studied in the project are now investigated to such an extent that one can speak of a kind of completeness of the corresponding part of the theory, and the related groups of results can be published in the form of monographs.",

        "description": "<strong>Objectives<\/strong>:<br \/>\r\nHysteresis, i.e., nonlinear relations exhibiting a complicated input-output behavior in form of nested loops that cannot be described by functions or graphs, occurs in many fields of science, e.g., in ferromagnetism, micromagnetics, solid-solid phase transitions, and elastoplasticity. Hysteretic systems carry a memory of their former states, which renders their input-output mapping both nondifferentiable and nonlocal in time, so that conventional weak convergence techniques for solving evolution systems fail. Therefore, dynamical elastoplastic processes with hysteresis are found in the mathematical literature much less frequently than quasistatic ones, and a substantial progress in this direction is necessary. In a recent breakthrough, it was shown that the three-dimensional single-yield von Mises constitutive law leads, after a dimensional reduction to beams or plates, to a multi-yield Prandtl-Ishlinskii hysteresis operator. It is in fact quite natural that the lower dimensional observer does not see any sharp transition from the purely elastic to the purely plastic regime as in the von Mises model: if a plate is bent then small plasticized zones start forming first near the boundary and then propagate to the interior, which still preserves a partial elasticity. This gradual plasticizing is reflected by the Prandtl-Ishlinskii superposition of single-yield elements that are successively activated. This new groundbreaking theory will be expanded to more complex structures like Mindlin-Reissner plates, and curved rods and shells. Temperature and material fatigue effects will be included. A thermodynamically consistent theory of temperature and fatigue dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii operators will be developed, along with efficient and reliable numerical methods. Questions of theoretical and numerical stability, and the long time behavior of the system of energy and momentum balance laws are central objectives.",

The purpose of this project is to acquire new knowledge in decentralized and coordination supervisory control of DES with a special emphasis on large distributed DES with global specifications using the concept of a coordinator. The project will focus on the basic concepts of coordination control, and on algorithms and methods for determining the minimal size coordinator. The optimal solution is in general a hard problem, therefore principles and methods of approximation algorithms and of game theory, such as Nash equilibrium etc., will be useful. The research will then be generalized to concepts and frameworks of decentralized and coordination control with partial observations with both local and global specifications, and on problems of decentralized control with communication controllers, such as fully decentralized control, fix communication structure, or communication when needed.",

Efficient and accurate solution of these problems requires the representation of various components by geometrically different meshes.

Further, we will investigate the existence and uniqueness of continuous and approximate solutions of problems that are often nonlinear. A special emphasize will be laid also on a priori and a posteriori error estimates, superconvergence, discrete maximum principle, stability of numerical schemes, etc.",

Second, we apply these tools in specific discourses: d) interrogative discourse (questions in logic and linguistics), e) deontic and cognitive discourse (applications in artificial inteligence and knowledge representation) f) inferential discourse (applications in philosophy of language and computer science).",

The results will be connected with optimality conditions for nonlinear problems in the calculus of variations and optimal control, since the second variation of these problems is a quadratic functional. An important aspect of this project is the inclusion of the theory of dynamic equations on time scales, which allows to study differential and difference equations and systems within one theory, to explain and understand the discrepancies between these theories, and at the same time to generalize them to other time scales. We will focus e.g. on symplectic systems without normality or on the theory of conjugate and coupled points for these systems. Furthermore, we will study effective criteria for the existence of solutions with prescribed properties and open problems arising in this area.",

There are several approaches to these difficult problems, one of which is proof complexity. In proof complexity we not only study the lengths of proofs in various proof systems, but also first order theories associated with complexity classes, collectively called bounded arithmetic. Proving separations between proof systems or theories in bounded arithmetic, however, seems as difficult as separating the corresponding complexity classes.<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"conteneur_midi texte\">\r\n\t<br \/>\r\n\tOur group has been working in proof complexity for more than two decades and has played an important role in the development of the field. The novelty of this project is its focus on the role of the following two concepts in proof complexity: incompleteness and pseudorandomness. The incompleteness phenomenon is well understood in the context of stronger arithmetical theories, but little is known in bounded arithmetic. As it may be extremely difficult to solve the problems about incompleteness in the polynomial time domain, one of the approaches we will try is proposing axioms that will decide these questions. Similarly, pseudorandomness has been intensively researched in computational complexity, but its role in proof complexity still needs more research. <a href=\"http:\/\/users.math.cas.cz\/%7Epudlak\/FEALORAdescription.pdf\" target=\"_blanc\" title=\"Description of the project Feasibility, Logic and Randomness (FEALORA)\"> <\/a><\/div>\r\n",

In this project we will study computationally efficient solutions to coordination supervisory control of large automata with product structure based on multi-level communication structure. Both logical automata and those stemming from discretizations will be considered. Decentralized supervisory control of automata without a priori known modular (product) structure will also be investigated.

As Easton showed, without extra assumptions, there is very little ZFC can prove about the continuum function on regulars.

The goal of this project is to exploit the complementary knowledge and experience of its participants, and classify the individual models within a larger thermomechanical context.
