The read-once property forms a frontier. More concretely, we may see the instances of our models as a systems $S=(U,D)$ where $U$ is a universe of knowledge and $D$ arederivation rules. We say that a b.p. $P$ is compatible with a system $S$ iff along each computation in $P$ $S$ derives $F$ ($false$) or $T$ ($true$) at the end correctly according to the label of the reached sink. This key notion modifies the classic paradigm according to which the computational complexity is defined with respect to different classes of restricted b.p.`s (e.g. read-once b.p.`s, k-b.p.`s, b.p.`s computing in limited time etc.). Now, the restriction is defined by a subset of systems and only these programs are taken into account which are compatible with at least one of the chosen systems. Further&nbsp; we may understand the sets $U$ of knowledge(s) as a sets of admissible logical formulae.&nbsp; More rich&nbsp; sets $U$`s imply the larger (= more free) restrictions on b.p.`s and consequently the smaller complexities of Boolean functions are detected.

Several recent works have established results of this form. In the most intriguing cases, the required lower bound is known for problems that appear to be significantly easier than Q, while Q itself is susceptible to lower bounds but these are not yet sufficient for magnification. In this work, we provide more examples of this phenomenon, and investigate the prospects of proving new lower bounds using this approach. In particular, we consider the following essential questions associated with the hardness magnification program:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Does hardness magnification avoid the natural proofs barrier of Razborov and Rudich?<br />\r\n- Can we adapt known lower bound techniques to establish the desired lower bound for Q?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe establish that some instantiations of hardness magnification overcome the natural proofs barrier in the following sense: slightly superlinear-size circuit lower bounds for certain versions of the minimum circuit size problem MCSP imply the non-existence of natural proofs. As a corollary of our result, we show that certain magnification theorems not only imply strong worst-case circuit lower bounds but also rule out the existence of efficient learning algorithms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHardness magnification might sidestep natural proofs, but we identify a source of difficulty when trying to adapt existing lower bound techniques to prove strong lower bounds via magnification. This is captured by a locality barrier: existing magnification theorems unconditionally show that the problems Q considered above admit highly efficient circuits extended with small fan-in oracle gates, while lower bound techniques against weak circuit models quite often easily extend to circuits containing such oracles. This explains why direct adaptations of certain lower bounds are unlikely to yield strong complexity separations via hardness magnification.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a joint work with Lijie Chen, Shuichi Hirahara, Igor C.
